                <h3> Steps to Make it </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Start the sauce about 30 minutes in advance. 
                        In a large deep saucepan over medium heat, 
                        saut√© the onion and garlic in 3 tablespoons of olive oil until onions are soft.</li>
                    <li>Add the ground beef and brown, stirring frequently.</li>   
                    <li>Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring until bubbling, 
                        about 3 minutes. Add water, 
                        tomatoes, salt, basil, cayenne pepper, and bay leaf. Stir well.</li>
                    <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer slowly, uncovered, for 15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.</li>    
                </ol>

                <h3>Assemble the lasagna and Bake</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a stockpot full of water to a rolling boil and season with salt. Add the lasagna noodles 
                        and cook as the package directs, 
                        stirring frequently to prevent sticking. Drain and toss gently with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.</li>

                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F and grab a large 3-quart rectangular baking dish.</li>
                    <li>Spoon 4 to 6 tablespoons of the sauce or just enough to cover the bottom of the baking dish.</li>
                    <li>Top with a single layer of noodles. Spoon about 1/3 of the remaining sauce over the noodles. Spoon about 1/2 of the ricotta cheese 
                        evenly over the layer of sauce, 
                        then sprinkle a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese over that. Add about 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese.</li>
                    <li>Repeat with another 1/3 of noodles, 
                        another 1/3 of the sauce, the remaining ricotta, another 1/3 of the mozzarella and a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese.</li>  
                    <li>Finish with the last layer of noodles, the remaining sauce, Parmesan, and mozzarella cheese.</li>   
                    <li>Bake the lasagna, uncovered, for 45 minutes. If the top is browning too fast or the noodles are burning, cover loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
                    <li>Remove from oven and let cool 10 minutes before slicing into squares and serving. </li>
